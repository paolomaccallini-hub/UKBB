# UKBB
This software performs GWAS analysis on summary statistics generated by Neale's Lab from the UK Biobank database. In particular, it defines risk loci and performs fine-mapping and gene mapping.

All the settings, including the traits to study, are in the YML file. The uploaded file is set for analysis of the following two phenotypes: 20002_1482 (self-reported Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and ICD-10: R53 (Chronic Fatigue). But the phenotypes of interest can be any of the list: https://broad-ukb-sumstats-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/round2/annotations/phenotypes.both_sexes.v2.tsv.bgz.

It is sufficient to put the three files of the repository in a folder and run UKBB_main.R in RStudio to download and build the required database. Also, it is necessary to put in the same folder the RegulomeDB scores, available here: https://www.regulomedb.org/regulome-search/
